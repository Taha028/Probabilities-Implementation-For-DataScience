In the game below, we will create a poker game where each player is dealt five cards and the player with better hand wins. Let’s estimate probability of getting at least two of a kind, i.e. 2 cards of different suites but same numeric values (e.g. 2 of hearts, 2 of spades and 3 of other cards). I have already created a array called deck_of_cards basically created a deck of cards. It’s a big one, so I am just putting first few line of codes. We will run the simulation for 5 million times and estimate the probability for getting at least two of a kind."
